# ha-roku-mjpeg-app
An app to cast MJPEG to roku. This does not currently work it was a test for parsing mjpeg data. This was tested with MotionEye. Roku can't handle raw jpegs capture. A JPEG decompression/recompression algorithm would have to be implemented.

This project is left as is for educational purposes.
